First, install the dcm2niix by rinning "install_dcm2niix.sh". This will create a folder in the working directory.

Then, the preprocessing steps can run in order:
1. We convert the DICOM files to nifti files and save in BIDS format
2. Add some information about the study so that the BIDS directory is valid
3. We extract events of the experiment from the psychopy logs. Events of interest are the onset of the healthy eating call and the presentation of products
4. We preprocess the structural and functional MRI data with fMRI prep
5. We apply additional cleaning of the data, since fMRIprep only applies "minimal preprocessing"
6. We check whether some participants moved their heads too much during scanner, so that we can exclude them
7. We crop the clean BOLD signal according to the period of the healthy eating call for each participant
8. We average the cropped clean BOLD signal within the ROIs of the AAL3 and save in excel/csv files
